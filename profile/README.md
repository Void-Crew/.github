Void-Crew is a dedicated PVE-focused Space Station 13 (SS13) server that offers a unique and immersive gaming experience centered around ship-based gameplay. Unlike traditional SS13 servers where players are confined to a stationary station, Void-Crew takes a bold approach by granting each player their own personal shuttle and crew. This innovative concept allows players to traverse the vast cosmos, embarking on exhilarating adventures such as exploring distant planets, deciphering ancient runes, and navigating treacherous asteroid fields.

At the helm of Void-Crew's administration and development stands a close-knit team of highly committed individuals who work tirelessly to enhance the overall gaming experience for their community. These developers, led by the visionary and co-owners KingDoogan and Veiyna (known as Alysiah), form the backbone of the Void-Crew organization.

This talented and dedicated team of developers employs their expertise to introduce a plethora of improvements, customizations, and features that make Void-Crew a standout SS13 server. Their work spans a broad spectrum of tasks, including coding, game balance adjustments, crafting engaging storylines and events, and ensuring the server runs smoothly and efficiently.

KingDoogan, a seasoned administrator and co-owner, brings a wealth of experience to the team. With a keen eye for innovation, he plays a pivotal role in shaping the server's unique offerings. Meanwhile, Veiyna (Alysiah), another co-owner, contributes their creative talents to craft immersive and captivating narratives that keep players engaged and immersed in the Void-Crew universe.

We also have a special team of amazing in-game administrators & mappers ( Special thanks to all of you, for keeping us alive! ) 

In addition to these two influential leaders, Void-Crew is bolstered by a devoted team of moderators, builders, and support staff who collectively ensure the server's integrity and create an environment where players can enjoy their spacefaring adventures to the fullest.

As Void-Crew continues to evolve and expand, its commitment to providing an unparalleled ship-based SS13 experience remains at the forefront, all thanks to the dedication and vision of its leadership and the collaborative efforts of its entire team.
